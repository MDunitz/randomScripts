from US metal mines could reduce import reliance for critical minerals\"&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Recovering just 1% of critical minerals currently discarded in mine tailings\ncould substantially reduce US reliance on imports. At 90% recovery, existing mines could meet nearly all\ndomestic demand for critical minerals needed for energy, defense, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mine Types and Byproduct Potential:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porphyry Copper&lt;/strong&gt; (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana): Primary source of Mo, Re;\nsignificant Ag, Au, Te, Se potential&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlin-Type Gold&lt;/strong&gt; (Nevada): High As content; potential for Sb, Hg recovery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mississippi Valley Type Zn-Pb&lt;/strong&gt; (Missouri, Tennessee): Cd, Ge, In potential&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEDEX Zn-Pb&lt;/strong&gt; (Alaska Red Dog): Co, Cd, Ge potential&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbonatite REE&lt;/strong&gt; (California Mountain Pass): Full suite of REEs, Nb, Ta&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultramafic PGE&lt;/strong&gt; (Montana Stillwater): Pt, Pd, Rh, plus Ni, Cu, Co&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIF Iron&lt;/strong&gt; (Minnesota): V, Ti potential from tailings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; The US already mines materials containing critical minerals but\ntypically discards them because current mining operations are not designed for byproduct recovery.\nSmall investments in processing technology could unlock domestic critical mineral supply chains without\nnew mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map shows 54 federally permitted metal mines analyzed in the study. Mine locations from\nUSGS MRData and company technical reports. Not all 56 mines from Data S2 are shown due to coordinate availability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n"}}]}}]}}
